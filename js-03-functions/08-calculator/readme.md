# Calculator üî¢

This exercise demonstrates the use of functions inside other functions in javascript.
The exercise will perform a series of calculations given a number.

## Assignment üìù

> Write a function that will take one parameter (a number) and perform the
following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:
> - Take half of the number and store the result
> - Square the result of #1 and store that result
> - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius
> - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3)

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.
