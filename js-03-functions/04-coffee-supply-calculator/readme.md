# Coffee Supply Calculator ‚òï

This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the total amount of coffee in cups and liters needed for the rest of your life using simple JavaScript functions.

## Assignment üìù

> 1. Write a function named `calculateSupply` that:
  > - Takes 2 parameters: age and amount per day.
  > - calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
  > - outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN cups of coffee to last you until the age of X"
> 2. Call that function three times, passing in different values each time
  >
  > **Bonus**  
  > Calculate in liters, accepting floating point values for amount per day (0.3 liters of coffee)
  > Round the result to a round number

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.
