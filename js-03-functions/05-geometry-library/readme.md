# Geometry Library üìê

This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the circumference and area of a circle using simple JavaScript functions.

## Assignment üìù

>1. Create a function called `calcCircumference`:
>   - Pass the radius to the function.
>   - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
>2. Create a function called `calcArea`:
>   - Pass the radius to the function.
>   - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Functions üìã

### `calcCircumference(radius)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the circumference of a circle based on the provided radius.
- **Parameters**:
  - `radius` (number): The radius of the circle.
- **Output**: Returns a string with the calculated circumference.

### `calcArea(radius)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the area of a circle based on the provided radius.
- **Parameters**:
  - `radius` (number): The radius of the circle.
- **Output**: Returns a string with the calculated area.

## Using `Math.PI` üìê

In both functions, `Math.PI` is used to get the value of œÄ (pi), which is approximately 3.14159. This value is essential for calculating the circumference and area of a circle:
- The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula `2 * œÄ * radius`.
- The area of a circle is calculated using the formula `œÄ * radius^2`.

## Example Output üìú

>*The circumference is 31.41592653589793*  
>*The area is 78.53981633974483*
