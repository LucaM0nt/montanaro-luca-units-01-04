# Math Library 🔢

This exercise demonstrates how to perform various mathematical calculations using simple JavaScript functions.

## Assignment 📝

> - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one parameter (a
number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a
string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
> - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one parameter (a
number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like
"Half of 5 is 2.5."
> - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out
what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return
the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
> - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one parameter (the
radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also
log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is
12.566370614359172."  
> **Bonus:** round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal

## Usage 🛠️

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Functions 📋

### `squareNumber(num)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the square of a number based on the provided value.
- **Parameters**:
  - `num` (number): The number to be squared.
- **Output**: Returns the squared number and logs the result to the console.

### `halfNumber(num)`

- **Description**: This function calculates half of a number based on the provided value.
- **Parameters**:
  - `num` (number): The number to be halved.
- **Output**: Returns half of the number and logs the result to the console.

### `percentOf(num1, num2)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the percentage of one number relative to another based on the provided values.
- **Parameters**:
  - `num1` (number): The first number.
  - `num2` (number): The second number.
- **Output**: Returns the percentage and logs the result to the console.

### `areaOfCircle(radius)`

- **Description**: This function calculates the area of a circle based on the provided radius.
- **Parameters**:
  - `radius` (number): The radius of the circle.
- **Output**: Returns the area of the circle and logs the result to the console.

## Example Output 📜

```javascript
squareNumber(4); // "The result of squaring the number 4 is 16"  
halfNumber(10); // "Half of 10 is 5"
percentOf(2, 4); // "2 is 50.00% of 4" 
areaOfCircle(5); // "The area for a circle with radius 5 is 78.54"
```
