# Easy Multiplication ‚úñÔ∏è

This exercise demonstrates the use of loops in JavaScript.
The script iterates through numbers from 0 to 10 and logs the multiplication table of 9.
Additionally, it uses a nested loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10.

## Assignment üìù
> Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10.
> For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log
the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").  
>  
> **Bonus**: 
> - Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1
to 10 (100 results total).


## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Code Content üìÑ

The file `script.js` contains:
- Two `for` loops:
  - The first loop iterates from 0 to 10 and logs the multiplication table of 9.
  - The second loop is a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 10 and logs the multiplication tables for each multiplier from 0 to 10.
- No functions are defined in this script.
- Variables used:
  - `i`: Loop counter for the outer loops.
  - `j`: Loop counter for the inner loop.
  - `num`: Stores the result of the multiplication.

## Example Output üìú

### Multiplication Table of 9

| Multiplier | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 9 * 0      | 0      |
| 9 * 1      | 9      |
| 9 * 2      | 18     |
| ...        | ...    |
| 9 * 10     | 90     |

### All Multiplication Tables from 1 to 10

| Multiplier | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 1 * 0      | 0      |
| 1 * 1      | 1      |
| ...        | ...    |
| 10 * 10    | 100    |
