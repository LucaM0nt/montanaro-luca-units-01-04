# Odd or Even 🔢

This exercise demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements in JavaScript.
The script iterates through numbers from 1 to 20 and logs whether each number is odd or even.

## Assignment 📝

> - Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20.
> - For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and
report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even")


## Usage 🛠️

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Code Content 📄

The file `script.js` contains:
- A `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 20.
- A conditional statement that checks if a number is odd or even.
- Variables used:
  - `x`: Loop counter.

## Example Output 📜

```javascript
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
...
20 is even
```
