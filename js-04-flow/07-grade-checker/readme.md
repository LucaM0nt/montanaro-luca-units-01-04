# Grade Checker 📝

This exercise demonstrates the use of imported functions and loops in JavaScript.
The script imports the `assignGrade` function and uses it to log grades for scores from 60 to 100.

## Assignment 📝

> Write a loop that tests the function that you wrote earlier “assignGrade”.
> - Check every value from 60 to 100:  
>
> your log should show:
> - “For 88, you got a B.”
> - “For 89, you got a B.”
> - “For 90, you got an A.”
> - etc.


## Usage 🛠️

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.
